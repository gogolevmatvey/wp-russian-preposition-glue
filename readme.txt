Adds Russian typography spacing rules without changing saved post content.

== Description ==

Russian Typography applies focused Russian typography rules to rendered HTML.

The plugin can:

* glue short Russian semantic words to the related word with a non-breaking space;
* glue historical abbreviations such as `n. e.` and `do n. e.` in Russian text;
* glue numbers with common Russian units such as `5 km`, `480 year`, and `24 hours`;
* limit processing to single posts and pages;
* disable typography for selected heading levels and for post/card titles that pass through `the_title()`;
* keep long next words breakable in full mode with a separate length threshold;
* imitate Art. Lebedev Typograf spacing locally in the `standart` mode.

The plugin does not modify saved post content in the database.
The `standart` mode imitates spaces only; it does not call the external Typograf service and does not change quotes, dashes, punctuation, or saved content.


Spacing modes:

* `soft`: conservative gluing for one-letter service words with a next-word length limit;
* `full`: semantic gluing for short prepositions, conjunctions, particles, and pronouns with a separate next-word length limit;
* `standart`: local spacing rules calibrated closer to Art. Lebedev Typograf; no external service calls and no quote, dash, punctuation, or database changes;
* `off`: disables short-word gluing while keeping abbreviation and number/unit spacing rules.

The `standart` mode also keeps common historical dates, centuries, units, percentages, digit groups, initials, and dash spacing closer to the saved Typograf fixtures used during development.

No. Processing runs only when HTML is rendered.

Yes. Disable typography for the needed heading levels (`h1`-`h6`) in Settings -> Russian Typography. Post and card titles that pass through `the_title()` have a separate setting.

= What happens when the plugin is uninstalled? =

When removed through WordPress, the plugin deletes its saved settings from `wp_options`.
